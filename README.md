Movie library system using java

It is very basic movie library system designed using java. It takes command line input output only. 

To run this project, first download all the files, and run Cassette_Library.java file.

The already added users are:

Admin-> 

        Username: Ishika
        Password: Password
        
        Username: Greeva
        Password: Password
        
Member->

         Username: ishika
         Password: password

New admin can be added in the Login.java file, in lines 6 and 8. The variables have been made private so that they are accessed by only the adminstrators. The assumption here is that new staff members must be added by the system creator only.

New members can be added by signing in as admin. The assumption has been made that this system is used only by the Movie Library Staff, and hence the members to be added must be done via them only.
